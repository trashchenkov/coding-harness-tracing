# Manage Codex Tracing

Configure OpenInference tracing for the OpenAI Codex CLI to Arize AX (cloud) or Phoenix (self-hosted). Spans are sent directly to the backend from Codex's native lifecycle hooks — no OTEL collector or background process runs in the user's environment.

The primary tool is the **`ax-trace`** CLI. It installs a managed Python runtime (via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)), writes the Codex hook config, and manages settings. Reach for the repo only to inspect hook/handler internals: <https://github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing> (Codex code under `tracing/codex/`).

## Codex architecture (read this first)

Codex tracing is more involved than the other harnesses. It uses **native Codex CLI hooks** plus the legacy `notify` hook as a token-usage backstop:

- `SessionStart` / `UserPromptSubmit` → `arize-hook-codex-session` (updates per-thread state at `~/.arize/harness/state/codex/state_<thread_id>.yaml`)
- `PreToolUse` / `PostToolUse` / `PermissionRequest` → `arize-hook-codex-tool` (appends rows to `spans_<thread_id>.jsonl`)
- `Stop` → `arize-hook-codex-stop` (builds the parent LLM span + TOOL child spans, sends, clears state)
- `agent-turn-complete` (`notify`) → `arize-hook-codex-notify` (writes token counts into state; Codex hook payloads don't carry exact token usage)

There is **no OTEL exporter / collector** anymore — spans go straight to Phoenix (REST) or Arize AX (gRPC) via `send_span()`.

**Trust prompt:** Codex requires explicit approval before non-managed hooks fire. After install the user must start `codex`, run `/hooks`, and approve each `arize-hook-codex-*` entry. Until then tracing falls back to `notify`-only (a single flat Turn span per turn, no tool spans).

## How to use this skill

1. **Installing / adding tracing?** → [Install](#install)
2. **Have credentials, changing a setting?** → [Configure via the CLI](#configure-via-the-cli)
3. **Not working / debugging?** → [Diagnose with doctor](#diagnose-with-doctor) then [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)
4. **No backend account yet?** → [Backends](#backends) first

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing/cmd/ax-trace@latest
ax-trace add codex
```

`ax-trace add codex` bootstraps the runtime, writes the managed hook block into `~/.codex/config.toml`, and runs the wizard. Fields collected:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Backend | `arize` or `phoenix` |
| API key | `ARIZE_API_KEY` / `PHOENIX_API_KEY` — env var or masked prompt, never a flag |
| Space ID | Arize only |
| OTLP / Phoenix endpoint | Arize defaults to `otlp.arize.com:443`; Phoenix to `http://localhost:6006` |
| Project name | Defaults to `codex` |
| User ID | Optional; added to every span as `user.id` |
| Content logging | Three prompts (prompts / tool details / tool content), default **on** |
| Verbose | Terminal trace summaries, default **off** |

**After install, remind the user to trust the hooks**: start `codex`, run `/hooks`, approve the `arize-hook-codex-*` entries.

**Non-interactive:**

```bash
export ARIZE_API_KEY=...
ax-trace add codex --backend arize --space-id SPACE_ID --project-name codex --non-interactive
```

## Backends

### Arize AX (cloud)

SaaS uses `otlp.arize.com:443`; on-prem needs a custom OTLP endpoint. Get credentials: log in (https://app.arize.com), **Settings** → **Space ID** on Space Settings; **API Keys** tab to create/copy a key. Both `api_key` and `space_id` required.

### Phoenix (self-hosted)

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix && phoenix serve   # or: docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

UI at `http://localhost:6006`. Verify: `curl -sf http://localhost:6006/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo ok`.

## Configure via the CLI

Backend credentials live in `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`. The Codex hook wiring lives in `~/.codex/config.toml` (managed block, written by `ax-trace add codex` — don't hand-edit it). Edit backend settings with `ax-trace config`:

```bash
ax-trace config show                              # api_key masked
ax-trace config set harnesses.codex.project_name codex
ax-trace config set verbose true
ax-trace config edit
```

Schema:

```yaml
harnesses:
  codex:
    project_name: codex
    target: arize                   # arize | phoenix
    endpoint: otlp.arize.com:443    # OTLP (arize) or Phoenix URL
    api_key: <key>
    space_id: <id>                  # arize only
logging:
  prompts: true
  tool_details: true
  tool_content: true
user_id: ""
verbose: false                      # ARIZE_VERBOSE env wins over this
```

## Diagnose with doctor

```bash
ax-trace doctor
```

Pure-Go health check (works even when the venv is broken). `✓`/`✗` per check with remediation; non-zero exit on failure.

| Verdict | Meaning / fix |
|---------|---------------|
| `✗ venv` | Runtime missing/broken → `ax-trace add codex` or `ax-trace update` |
| `✗ settings:codex` | `~/.codex/config.toml` missing → re-run `ax-trace add codex` (doctor checks existence; TOML isn't parsed at v1) |
| `✗ env:codex` | No creds in env or config → `ax-trace config set harnesses.codex.api_key ...` |
| `✗ otlp_endpoint` | Endpoint unreachable → check network/endpoint |
| all `✓` but only single flat spans (no tool spans) | Hooks not trusted yet → run `codex`, `/hooks`, approve `arize-hook-codex-*` |

## Uninstall

```bash
ax-trace uninstall --codex     # remove Codex tracing, keep the shared runtime
ax-trace uninstall             # remove all harnesses + the shared runtime
```

Removes the managed block from `~/.codex/config.toml` and the `harnesses.codex` config entry; clears per-thread state under `~/.arize/harness/state/codex/`.

## Troubleshoot

Run `ax-trace doctor` first. Then:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Only one flat span per turn, no tool spans | Hooks not trusted → `codex` → `/hooks` → approve `arize-hook-codex-*` |
| No traces at all | Verify creds (`ax-trace config show`); confirm the managed block is in `~/.codex/config.toml` |
| Phoenix unreachable | `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces` |
| Missing token counts | Expected if `notify` didn't fire; native hooks still produce the span tree |
| Test without sending | `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` |
| Verbose logging | `ax-trace config set verbose true` (or `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true`); errors always go to `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex.log` |
| Wrong project name | `ax-trace config set harnesses.codex.project_name <name>` |
