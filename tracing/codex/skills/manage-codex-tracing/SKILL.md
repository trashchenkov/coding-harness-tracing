# Setup Codex Tracing

Configure OpenInference tracing for OpenAI Codex CLI sessions to Arize AX (cloud) or Phoenix (self-hosted).

## Architecture Overview

Codex tracing uses direct send for span export and a lightweight buffer service for event buffering:

1. **Direct send** (`core/common.py`) — spans are sent directly to Phoenix (REST) or Arize AX (gRPC) from the notify handler via `send_span()`. Per-harness backend credentials are read from `harnesses.codex.*` in config.

2. **Codex Buffer Service** (`tracing/codex/codex_buffer.py`, default port 4318) — a lightweight HTTP server that only buffers Codex OTLP log events between hook invocations. No export logic. Managed via `arize-codex-buffer`.

3. **Notify hook** (`arize-hook-codex-notify`) — Fires on `agent-turn-complete` events. Drains buffered events from the buffer service, transforms them into OpenInference child spans (TOOL spans for tool calls, LLM spans for API requests), enriches the parent Turn span with model name and token counts, and sends the complete span tree directly to the backend.

```
Codex CLI
  |
  |-- [otel] otlp-http --> POST /v1/logs --> buffer service (port 4318, buffers by thread-id)
  |
  |-- notify hook (agent-turn-complete) --> arize-hook-codex-notify
        |
        |--> GET /drain/{thread_id} (port 4318) --> get buffered events
        |--> Transform events into child spans
        |--> Build multi-span OTLP payload (Turn parent + children)
        |--> send_span() --> Phoenix/Arize AX
```

**Graceful degradation**: If the buffer service isn't running or returns no buffered events, the notify hook falls back to a single flat Turn span.

## Codex Exec Tracing

Interactive Codex tracing uses the `notify` hook and `[otel.exporter.otlp-http]`
configured in `~/.codex/config.toml`. The notify hook fires after each agent
turn to drain buffered events and send spans.

`codex exec` tracing requires the `arize-codex-proxy` entry point. The proxy
runs the real Codex binary and then drains buffered events after the process
exits. Without the proxy, `codex exec` bypasses the notify hook entirely.

The installer creates a `~/.arize/harness/bin/codex` shim that points to
`arize-codex-proxy` and adds `~/.arize/harness/bin` to supported shell profiles
for sh, bash, zsh, and PowerShell. On Windows, it also updates the user PATH.
Users should open a new shell after install so the PATH update is visible.

To verify exec tracing is active, run:

```bash
command -v codex
```

The output should resolve to `~/.arize/harness/bin/codex`.

## How to Use This Skill

**This skill follows a decision tree workflow.** Start by asking the user where they are in the setup process:

1. **Do they already have credentials?**
   - Yes → Jump to [Configure Codex](#configure-codex)
   - No → Continue to step 2

2. **Which backend do they want to use?**
   - Phoenix (self-hosted) → Go to [Set Up Phoenix](#set-up-phoenix)
   - Arize AX (cloud) → Go to [Set Up Arize AX](#set-up-arize-ax)

3. **Are they troubleshooting?**
   - Yes → Jump to [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)

**Important:** Only follow the relevant path for the user's needs. Don't go through all sections.

## Set Up Phoenix

Phoenix is self-hosted and requires no Python dependencies for tracing (spans are sent directly via `send_span()` using stdlib `urllib`).

### Install Phoenix

Ask if they already have Phoenix running. If not, walk through:

```bash
# Option A: pip
pip install arize-phoenix && phoenix serve

# Option B: Docker
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

Phoenix UI will be available at `http://localhost:6006`. Confirm it's running:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:6006/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo "Phoenix is running" || echo "Phoenix not reachable"
```

Then proceed to [Configure Codex](#configure-codex) with `PHOENIX_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:6006`.

## Set Up Arize AX

Arize AX is available as a SaaS platform or as an on-prem deployment. Users need an account, a space, and an API key.

**First, ask the user: "Are you using the Arize SaaS platform or an on-prem instance?"**

- **SaaS** → Uses the default endpoint (`otlp.arize.com:443`). Continue below.
- **On-prem** → The user will need to provide their custom OTLP endpoint (e.g., `otlp.mycompany.arize.com:443`). Ask for it and note it for the configure step where it will be set as `ARIZE_OTLP_ENDPOINT`.

### 1. Create an account

If the user doesn't have an Arize account:
- **SaaS**: Sign up at https://app.arize.com/auth/join
- **On-prem**: Contact their administrator for access

### 2. Get Space ID and API key

Walk the user through finding their credentials:
1. Log in to their Arize instance (https://app.arize.com for SaaS, or their on-prem URL)
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
3. The **Space ID** is shown on the Space Settings page
4. Go to the **API Keys** tab
5. Click **Create API Key** or copy an existing one

Both `ARIZE_API_KEY` and `ARIZE_SPACE_ID` are required.

### 3. Python dependencies (bundled with the package)

Arize AX uses gRPC for export, but the gRPC dependencies are bundled with the package — they are **not** required in the user's Python environment.  No `pip install` step is needed for basic tracing.

Then proceed to [Configure Codex](#configure-codex).

## Configure Codex

This section configures:
1. **Backend config** at `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`
2. **Environment variables** in `~/.codex/arize-env.sh`
3. **Notify hook** in `~/.codex/config.toml`
4. **Codex Buffer Service** — buffers native OTLP events for rich span trees
5. **Native OTLP export** in `~/.codex/config.toml` — routes to the buffer service

### Determine the integration path

Ask the user: **"Where is the Codex tracing directory located?"**

Common locations:
- If cloned: `./coding-harness-tracing/tracing/codex`
- If installed via the curl installer: `~/.arize/harness/tracing/codex`

Store this as `INTEGRATION_PATH` for the notify hook config.

### Step 1: Write the backend config

Write `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` with the backend credentials. The config file is the single source of truth for backend and harness settings.

**Important: read-merge-write.** If `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` already exists, read it first, add or update the `harnesses.codex` entry, and preserve existing backend credentials. Only prompt the user for backend credentials if there is no existing config.

**Phoenix:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.arize/harness/{bin,run,logs}
# Merge: add/update harnesses.codex, preserve existing backend settings
arize-config set harnesses.codex.project_name codex
```

If no config exists yet, create it:
```yaml
harnesses:
  codex:
    project_name: codex
    target: phoenix
    endpoint: http://localhost:6006
    api_key: ""
    collector:
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 4318
```

**Arize AX:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.arize/harness/{bin,run,logs}
arize-config set harnesses.codex.project_name codex
```

If no config exists yet, create it:
```yaml
harnesses:
  codex:
    project_name: codex
    target: arize
    endpoint: otlp.arize.com:443
    api_key: <key>
    space_id: <space-id>
    collector:
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 4318
```

### Step 2: Write the environment file (optional)

Environment variables are optional overrides — all backend credentials are in `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`. If the user needs env-var overrides, create `~/.codex/arize-env.sh`:

**Phoenix:**
```bash
cat > ~/.codex/arize-env.sh << 'EOF'
export ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED=true
export ARIZE_CODEX_BUFFER_PORT=4318
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.codex/arize-env.sh
```

If the user wants to associate spans with a user ID, add `export ARIZE_USER_ID="<user-id>"`.

**Arize AX:**
```bash
cat > ~/.codex/arize-env.sh << 'EOF'
export ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED=true
export ARIZE_CODEX_BUFFER_PORT=4318
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.codex/arize-env.sh
```

If the user wants to associate spans with a user ID, add `export ARIZE_USER_ID="<user-id>"`.

### Step 3: Add the notify hook to config.toml

Read `~/.codex/config.toml`. Add the `notify` line at the top level (NOT inside any `[section]`):

```toml
notify = ["~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-codex-notify"]
```

**Important:** If `notify` already exists in the config, update the existing line.

### Step 4: Configure OTLP export to buffer service

Add an `[otel]` section that routes Codex's native events to the buffer service (port 4318):

```toml
[otel]
[otel.exporter.otlp-http]
endpoint = "http://127.0.0.1:4318/v1/logs"
protocol = "json"
```

This routes Codex native telemetry to the buffer service, which buffers events until the notify hook drains them for child-span assembly.

### Step 5: Start the buffer service

Start the Codex buffer service:
```bash
arize-codex-buffer start
```

Check its status or stop it with:
```bash
arize-codex-buffer status
arize-codex-buffer stop
```

(The CLI supports `start`, `stop`, and `status` subcommands. The PID is recorded at `~/.arize/harness/run/codex-buffer.pid` so `start` is safe to re-run — it no-ops if the service is already up.)

The buffer service is a single lightweight process (~5MB RSS, stdlib Python, zero CPU when idle). It only buffers events — span export is handled directly by the notify hook.

**Note:** The installer handles Steps 1-5 automatically.  The manual steps above are for users who prefer to configure things themselves or need to troubleshoot.

### Validate

After writing the config, validate:

1. **Check config.toml is valid:**
```bash
cat ~/.codex/config.toml
```
Visually confirm the `notify` line is at the top level and the `[otel]` section points to `127.0.0.1:4318`.

2. **Check env file:**
```bash
source ~/.codex/arize-env.sh && echo "ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED=$ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED"
```

3. **Check buffer service is running:**
```bash
arize-codex-buffer status
```

4. **Phoenix connectivity** (if using Phoenix):
```bash
curl -sf ${PHOENIX_ENDPOINT}/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo "Phoenix reachable" || echo "Phoenix not reachable"
```

6. **Dry run test:**
```bash
ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true arize-hook-codex-notify '{"type":"agent-turn-complete","thread-id":"test-123","turn-id":"turn-1","cwd":"/tmp","input-messages":"hello","last-assistant-message":"hi there"}'
```
Should print: `[arize] DRY RUN:` followed by the span name.

### Confirm

Tell the user:
- Configuration saved to `~/.codex/config.toml`, `~/.codex/arize-env.sh`, and `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`
- Spans are sent directly to the backend from the notify hook
- The buffer service (port 4318) captures Codex native events for child-span assembly
- Traces will appear as rich span trees with child spans for tool calls and API requests
- Token totals live on the parent Turn LLM span, not on request child spans
- If the buffer service has no buffered events, tracing still works with flat Turn spans (graceful degradation)
- Mention `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` to test without sending data
- Mention `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` and `ARIZE_TRACE_DEBUG=true` for debug output
- Logs: buffer service at `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex-buffer.log`, harness at `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex.log` (errors always; routine activity requires `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` in `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` or the shell)

## Troubleshoot

Common issues and fixes:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Traces not appearing | Check `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED` is `true` in `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` |
| Notify hook not firing | Verify `notify` line in `~/.codex/config.toml` points to correct path |
| Phoenix unreachable | Verify Phoenix is running: `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces` |
| Buffer service not running | Check config: `cat ~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`. Start: `arize-codex-buffer start` |
| No output in terminal | Notify runs in background; check `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex.log` and `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex-buffer.log` |
| Want to test without sending | Set `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` in env or `export ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` |
| Want verbose logging | Set `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` in env or `export ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` |
| Wrong project name | Set `ARIZE_PROJECT_NAME` in `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` (default: `codex`) |
| Existing notify hook | Codex supports only one `notify` — create a wrapper script that calls both |
| Stale state files | Run: `rm -rf ~/.arize/harness/state/codex/state_*.yaml` |
| Flat spans only (no children) | Check buffer service: `arize-codex-buffer status`. Verify `[otel]` in config.toml points to `127.0.0.1:4318` |
| Buffer service not starting | Check Python 3.9+ is available. Check port 4318 isn't in use. See `~/.arize/harness/logs/codex-buffer.log` |
| User ID not appearing on spans | Set `ARIZE_USER_ID` in `~/.codex/arize-env.sh` or export before running Codex |
