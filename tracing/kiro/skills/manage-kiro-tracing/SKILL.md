description: Set up and manage Arize tracing for Kiro CLI sessions using the ax-trace CLI. Use when users want to set up Kiro tracing, configure Arize AX or Phoenix for Kiro, edit config, run diagnostics, choose or set a default traced agent, enable/disable tracing, or troubleshoot Kiro tracing. Triggers on "set up kiro tracing", "configure Arize for Kiro", "ax-trace", "enable kiro tracing", "setup-kiro-tracing", "kiro agent tracing", or any request about connecting Kiro CLI to Arize or Phoenix for observability.

# Manage Kiro Tracing

Configure OpenInference tracing for the Kiro CLI to Arize AX (cloud) or Phoenix (self-hosted). Spans are sent directly to the backend from hooks — no background process or backend-specific Python deps run in the user's environment. Each session emits LLM turns, tool calls, cost in credits, model info, and turn duration.

The primary tool is the **`ax-trace`** CLI. It installs a managed Python runtime (via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)), writes the tracing hooks into a Kiro agent, and manages config. Reach for the repo only to inspect hook/handler internals: <https://github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing> (Kiro code under `tracing/kiro/`).

## Kiro-specific: tracing is per-agent

Unlike the other harnesses, Kiro registers hooks **per agent**, not globally. Each agent is a JSON file at `~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json` with its own `hooks` block. Tracing only fires for the agent it was installed into, and **the agent must be selected at runtime**:

```bash
kiro-cli chat --agent arize-traced      # run the traced agent explicitly
kiro-cli agent set-default arize-traced  # ...or make it the default so `kiro-cli chat` uses it
```

So setup is tied to a specific agent name. `ax-trace add kiro` asks which agent (default `arize-traced`); it either creates that agent fresh or merges the five hook entries into an existing agent you name. Whenever you debug, **confirm which agent the user actually runs** — tracing in a different agent won't fire.

## How to use this skill

1. **Installing / adding tracing?** → [Install](#install)
2. **Have credentials, changing a setting?** → [Configure via the CLI](#configure-via-the-cli)
3. **Not working / debugging?** → [Diagnose with doctor](#diagnose-with-doctor) then [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)
4. **No backend account yet?** → [Backends](#backends) first

## Install

```bash
go install github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing/cmd/ax-trace@latest
ax-trace add kiro
```

`ax-trace add kiro` bootstraps the runtime, writes hooks into the chosen agent file, and runs the wizard. Fields collected:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Backend | `arize` or `phoenix` |
| API key | `ARIZE_API_KEY` / `PHOENIX_API_KEY` — env var or masked prompt, never a flag |
| Space ID | Arize only |
| OTLP / Phoenix endpoint | Arize defaults to `otlp.arize.com:443`; Phoenix to `http://localhost:6006` |
| Project name | Defaults to `kiro` |
| User ID | Optional; added to every span as `user.id` |
| Agent name | **Kiro-specific** — defaults to `arize-traced`; name an existing agent to add tracing without switching |
| Set as default? | **Kiro-specific** — runs `kiro-cli agent set-default <name>` so plain `kiro-cli chat` uses it |
| Content logging | Three prompts (prompts / tool details / tool content), default **on** |
| Verbose | Terminal trace summaries, default **off** |

All five Kiro events (`agentSpawn`, `userPromptSubmit`, `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`, `stop`) route to a single `arize-hook-kiro` entry point that dispatches on the event name.

**Non-interactive:**

```bash
export ARIZE_API_KEY=...
ax-trace add kiro --backend arize --space-id SPACE_ID --project-name kiro --non-interactive
```

After install, run with `kiro-cli chat --agent <name>` (or just `kiro-cli chat` if set as default).

## Backends

### Arize AX (cloud)

SaaS uses `otlp.arize.com:443`; on-prem needs a custom OTLP endpoint. Get credentials: log in (https://app.arize.com), **Settings** → **Space ID** on Space Settings; **API Keys** tab to create/copy a key. Both `api_key` and `space_id` required.

### Phoenix (self-hosted)

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix && phoenix serve   # or: docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

UI at `http://localhost:6006`. Verify: `curl -sf http://localhost:6006/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo ok`.

## Configure via the CLI

Backend credentials live in `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`. The hook wiring lives in the agent file `~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json` (written by `ax-trace add kiro`). Edit backend settings with `ax-trace config`:

```bash
ax-trace config show                              # api_key masked
ax-trace config set harnesses.kiro.project_name kiro
ax-trace config set verbose true
ax-trace config edit
```

Schema:

```yaml
harnesses:
  kiro:
    project_name: kiro
    target: arize                   # arize | phoenix
    endpoint: otlp.arize.com:443    # OTLP (arize) or Phoenix URL
    api_key: <key>
    space_id: <id>                  # arize only
logging:
  prompts: true
  tool_details: true
  tool_content: true
user_id: ""
verbose: false                      # ARIZE_VERBOSE env wins over this
```

## Diagnose with doctor

```bash
ax-trace doctor
```

Pure-Go health check (works even when the venv is broken). `✓`/`✗` per check with remediation; non-zero exit on failure.

| Verdict | Meaning / fix |
|---------|---------------|
| `✗ venv` | Runtime missing/broken → `ax-trace add kiro` or `ax-trace update` |
| `✗ settings:kiro` | Default agent file `~/.kiro/agents/arize-traced.json` missing → re-run `ax-trace add kiro`. **Note:** doctor checks the *default* agent path; if the user installed into a differently-named agent this can falsely fail — verify with `cat ~/.kiro/agents/<their-agent>.json` |
| `✗ env:kiro` | No creds in env or config → `ax-trace config set harnesses.kiro.api_key ...` |
| `✗ otlp_endpoint` | Endpoint unreachable → check network/endpoint |
| all `✓` but no traces | Confirm the user runs the traced agent (`--agent <name>` or set-default); see [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot) |

## Uninstall

```bash
ax-trace uninstall --kiro     # remove Kiro tracing, keep the shared runtime
ax-trace uninstall            # remove all harnesses + the shared runtime
```

Removes the Arize hook entries from each agent file; deletes the agent file only if the installer created it.

## Troubleshoot

Run `ax-trace doctor` first. Then:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| No traces | Confirm the user runs the traced agent: `kiro-cli chat --agent <name>`, or `kiro-cli agent set-default <name>` |
| Hooks in wrong agent | Check `cat ~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json` has the five `arize-hook-kiro` entries; re-run `ax-trace add kiro` naming the right agent |
| Phoenix unreachable | `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces` |
| Agent config rejected | `kiro-cli agent validate --path ~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json` |
| Test without sending | `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` (set before launching Kiro) |
| Verbose logging | `ax-trace config set verbose true` (or `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true`); errors always go to `~/.arize/harness/logs/kiro.log` |
| Wrong project name | `ax-trace config set harnesses.kiro.project_name <name>` |
