# Setup Cursor Tracing

Configure OpenInference tracing for Cursor IDE sessions to Arize AX (cloud) or Phoenix (self-hosted). Spans are sent directly to the backend from hooks -- no background process or backend-specific dependencies are needed in the user's environment.

## How to Use This Skill

**This skill follows a decision tree workflow.** Start by asking the user where they are in the setup process:

1. **Do they already have credentials?**
   - Yes -> Jump to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings)
   - No -> Continue to step 2

2. **Which backend do they want to use?**
   - Phoenix (self-hosted) -> Go to [Set Up Phoenix](#set-up-phoenix)
   - Arize AX (cloud) -> Go to [Set Up Arize AX](#set-up-arize-ax)

3. **Are they troubleshooting?**
   - Yes -> Jump to [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)

**Important:** Only follow the relevant path for the user's needs. Don't go through all sections.

## Set Up Phoenix

Phoenix is self-hosted. No Python dependencies are needed for tracing -- spans are sent directly via `send_span()` using stdlib `urllib`.

### Install Phoenix

Ask if they already have Phoenix running. If not, walk through:

```bash
# Option A: pip
pip install arize-phoenix && phoenix serve

# Option B: Docker
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

Phoenix UI will be available at `http://localhost:6006`. Confirm it's running:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:6006/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo "Phoenix is running" || echo "Phoenix not reachable"
```

Then proceed to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings) with the Phoenix endpoint.

## Set Up Arize AX

Arize AX is available as a SaaS platform or as an on-prem deployment. Users need an account, a space, and an API key.

**First, ask the user: "Are you using the Arize SaaS platform or an on-prem instance?"**

- **SaaS** -> Uses the default endpoint (`otlp.arize.com:443`). Continue below.
- **On-prem** -> The user will need to provide their custom OTLP endpoint (e.g., `otlp.mycompany.arize.com:443`). Ask for it and note it for the [Configure Settings](#configure-settings) step.

### 1. Create an account

If the user doesn't have an Arize account:
- **SaaS**: Sign up at https://app.arize.com/auth/join
- **On-prem**: Contact their administrator for access to the on-prem instance

### 2. Get Space ID and API key

Walk the user through finding their credentials:
1. Log in to their Arize instance (https://app.arize.com for SaaS, or their on-prem URL)
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
3. The **Space ID** is shown on the Space Settings page
4. Go to the **API Keys** tab
5. Click **Create API Key** or copy an existing one

Both `api_key` and `space_id` are required for the shared config.

**No Python dependencies are needed.** Both Phoenix and Arize AX use HTTP/JSON — no additional Python dependencies are needed.

Then proceed to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings). If the user is on an on-prem instance, remind them to provide their custom endpoint.

## Configure Settings

**Important:** Users must run this setup before tracing will work. The `send_span()` function requires `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` to exist for backend credential resolution.

### Ask the user for:

1. **Backend choice**: Phoenix or Arize AX
2. **Credentials** (only if no existing config):
   - Phoenix: endpoint URL (default: `http://localhost:6006`), optional API key
   - Arize AX: API key and Space ID
3. **OTLP Endpoint** (Arize AX only, optional): For hosted Arize instances using a custom endpoint. Defaults to `otlp.arize.com:443`.
4. **Project name** (optional): defaults to `"cursor"`, stored under `harnesses.cursor.project_name`
5. **User ID** (optional): Set `ARIZE_USER_ID` env var to identify spans by user (useful for teams)

### Write the config

The config file at `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` is the single source of truth for backend credentials and per-harness settings. Create the directory structure if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.arize/harness/{bin,run,logs,state/cursor}`

**Important: read-merge-write.** If `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` already exists, read it first, then merge in the new or updated fields (e.g., add/update the `harnesses.cursor` entry) while preserving existing backend credentials. Only prompt for backend credentials if no existing config is found.

**Phoenix:**
```yaml
harnesses:
  cursor:
    project_name: cursor
    target: phoenix
    endpoint: <endpoint>
    api_key: ""
```

**Arize AX:**
```yaml
harnesses:
  cursor:
    project_name: cursor
    target: arize
    endpoint: otlp.arize.com:443
    api_key: <key>
    space_id: <id>
```

If the user has a custom OTLP endpoint, set it in `harnesses.cursor.endpoint`.

### Activate Cursor hooks

Cursor uses a `.cursor/hooks.json` file in the project root to route hook events to the handler. All events route to a single `arize-hook-cursor` CLI entry point, which dispatches based on `hook_event_name` in the JSON payload.

Create `.cursor/hooks.json` in the user's project (or merge into it if it already exists):

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "sessionEnd": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeSubmitPrompt": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterAgentResponse": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterAgentThought": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeShellExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterShellExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeMCPExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterMCPExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeReadFile": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterFileEdit": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "stop": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeTabFileRead": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterTabFileEdit": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "postToolUse": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }]
  }
}
```

If the user already has a `.cursor/hooks.json` with other hooks, merge the Arize entries into the existing arrays for each event.

### Validate

1. **Config exists**: Run `cat ~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` to verify the config file exists and has correct backend credentials.
2. **Phoenix** (if applicable): Run `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces >/dev/null` to check connectivity.
3. **Hooks active**: Verify `.cursor/hooks.json` exists in the project root and contains the Arize hook entries.

### Confirm

Tell the user:
- Config saved to `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`
- Cursor hooks activated via `.cursor/hooks.json`
- Spans are sent directly to the backend from hooks — no background process needed
- After saving, open a new Cursor session and traces will appear in their Phoenix UI or Arize AX dashboard under the project name
- Mention `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` to test without sending data (set as env var before launching Cursor)
- Mention `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` for debug output
- Errors are always written to `~/.arize/harness/logs/cursor.log`; set `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` in the shell before launching Cursor to also capture routine hook activity

## Hook Events

### IDE Hooks

Cursor IDE fires 15 hook events. Here's what each one traces:

| Event | Span Name | Kind | Description |
|-------|-----------|------|-------------|
| `sessionStart` | Session Start | CHAIN | Root span for the conversation; captures session metadata |
| `beforeSubmitPrompt` | User Prompt | CHAIN | Root span for the turn; captures prompt text, model, attachments |
| `afterAgentResponse` | Agent Response | LLM | LLM response text and model name |
| `afterAgentThought` | Agent Thinking | CHAIN | Agent thinking/reasoning text |
| `beforeShellExecution` | (state push) | -- | Saves command and start time to disk state |
| `afterShellExecution` | Shell | TOOL | Merged span with command input and output |
| `beforeMCPExecution` | (state push) | -- | Saves tool name, input, and start time |
| `afterMCPExecution` | MCP: {tool} | TOOL | Merged span with tool input and result |
| `beforeReadFile` | Read File | TOOL | File path being read |
| `afterFileEdit` | File Edit | TOOL | File path and edit details |
| `beforeTabFileRead` | Tab Read File | TOOL | Tab file read (file path) |
| `afterTabFileEdit` | Tab File Edit | TOOL | Tab file edit (path and edits) |
| `postToolUse` | Tool: {name} | TOOL | Generic tool span; postToolUse is suppressed for tools with a dedicated handler (Shell, Read, File Edit, Tab ops, MCP) to avoid duplicate spans |
| `stop` | Agent Stop | CHAIN | Per-turn stop event with token counts when available |
| `sessionEnd` | Session End | CHAIN | End-of-session span with duration and final status |

Shell and MCP events use a disk-backed state stack to merge before/after context into single spans with both input and output.

### CLI Hooks

Cursor CLI currently emits a smaller hook surface than the IDE. The supported
CLI hooks in this package are:

- `sessionStart`
- `sessionEnd`
- `beforeShellExecution`
- `afterShellExecution`
- `afterFileEdit`
- `postToolUse`
- `stop`

Cursor CLI hooks do not currently emit afterAgentResponse or afterAgentThought.

Full Cursor CLI assistant and thinking coverage requires parsing --output-format stream-json, which is out of scope for this change.

### What We Capture

- **`sessionStart`** produces a `Session Start` CHAIN span that acts as the root for the conversation.
- **`sessionEnd`** produces a `Session End` CHAIN span with `cursor.session.duration_ms`, `cursor.session.final_status`, `cursor.session.reason`, and end-of-session token counts when available.
- **`stop`** produces an `Agent Stop` CHAIN span with per-turn token counts captured when the payload includes them: `llm.token_count.prompt`, `llm.token_count.completion`, `llm.token_count.cache_read`, `llm.token_count.cache_write`, `llm.token_count.total`, and `llm.model_name`.
- **`postToolUse`** produces a generic `Tool: <name>` span ONLY for tools without a dedicated handler. Shell, file read/edit, tab file ops, and MCP execution are handled by their dedicated `before*`/`after*` events; the generic postToolUse is suppressed for these to avoid duplicate spans.

Every span includes `cursor.conversation.id` as a span attribute. Since `sessionStart` and per-turn activity use different `trace_id` values, `cursor.conversation.id` is the recommended cross-trace join key in Arize. To gather all activity for a Cursor session regardless of trace, filter spans by `attributes.cursor.conversation.id = "<id>"`.

### Hooks JSON Example (IDE + CLI)

When configuring `.cursor/hooks.json`, include both IDE and CLI events:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "hooks": {
    "sessionStart": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "sessionEnd": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeSubmitPrompt": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterAgentResponse": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterAgentThought": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeShellExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterShellExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeMCPExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterMCPExecution": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeReadFile": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterFileEdit": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "stop": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "beforeTabFileRead": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "afterTabFileEdit": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }],
    "postToolUse": [{ "command": "~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-cursor" }]
  }
}
```

## Troubleshoot

Common issues and fixes:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Traces not appearing | Verify config exists: `cat ~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`. Check hook log: `tail -20 ~/.arize/harness/logs/cursor.log` |
| Config missing | Run the installer or create `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` manually (include `harnesses.cursor` section) |
| Phoenix unreachable | Verify Phoenix is running: `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces` |
| Hooks not firing | Verify `.cursor/hooks.json` exists in the project root and paths are correct (use absolute paths) |
| Shell/MCP spans missing input | State push failed -- check that `~/.arize/harness/state/cursor/` is writable |
| Want to test without sending | Set `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` env var before launching Cursor |
| Want verbose logging | Set `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` env var before launching Cursor |
| Wrong project name | Set `harnesses.cursor.project_name` in `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` (default: `"cursor"`) |
| Spans missing user attribution | Set `ARIZE_USER_ID` env var before launching Cursor |
