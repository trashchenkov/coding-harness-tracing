# Manage Claude Code Tracing

Configure OpenInference tracing for Claude Code (CLI or Agent SDK) to Arize AX (cloud) or Phoenix (self-hosted). Spans are sent directly to the backend from hooks — no background process or backend-specific Python deps run in the user's environment.

The primary tool is the **`ax-trace`** CLI. It installs a managed Python runtime (via [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)), registers the Claude Code hooks, and manages config. Reach for the repo only when you need to inspect hook/handler internals: <https://github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing> (Claude Code code under `tracing/claude_code/`).

## How to use this skill

Figure out which path the user needs — don't walk through every section:

1. **Installing for the first time / adding tracing?** → [Install](#install)
2. **Have credentials, need to change a setting (project name, backend, logging)?** → [Configure via the CLI](#configure-via-the-cli)
3. **Tracing not working / debugging?** → [Diagnose with doctor](#diagnose-with-doctor) then [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)
4. **Building on the Agent SDK (Python/TypeScript)?** → [Agent SDK setup](#agent-sdk-setup)
5. **No backend account/credentials yet?** → [Backends](#backends) first

## Install

```bash
# install the CLI (any platform with Go)
go install github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing/cmd/ax-trace@latest

# configure Claude Code tracing (interactive)
ax-trace add claude
```

`ax-trace add claude` bootstraps the runtime, registers hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json`, and runs an interactive wizard. The wizard collects:

| Field | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| Backend | `arize` or `phoenix` |
| API key | `ARIZE_API_KEY` / `PHOENIX_API_KEY` — env var or masked prompt, never a flag |
| Space ID | Arize only |
| OTLP / Phoenix endpoint | Arize defaults to `otlp.arize.com:443`; Phoenix to `http://localhost:6006` |
| Project name | Defaults to `claude-code` |
| User ID | Optional; added to every span as `user.id` |
| Content logging | Three prompts (prompts / tool details / tool content), default **on** |
| Verbose | Print trace summaries to terminal, default **off** |

**Non-interactive (CI/scripts)** — pass fields as flags, key via env var:

```bash
export ARIZE_API_KEY=...
ax-trace add claude \
  --backend arize --space-id SPACE_ID \
  --project-name my-project --non-interactive
```

Restart the Claude Code session after install for hooks to take effect.

## Backends

### Arize AX (cloud)

Ask whether they're on SaaS or on-prem. SaaS uses `otlp.arize.com:443`; on-prem needs their custom OTLP endpoint.

To get credentials: log in (https://app.arize.com for SaaS), open **Settings** → the **Space ID** is on Space Settings; the **API Keys** tab creates/reveals an API key. Both `api_key` and `space_id` are required.

### Phoenix (self-hosted)

If they don't already run Phoenix:

```bash
pip install arize-phoenix && phoenix serve   # or: docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

UI at `http://localhost:6006`. Verify: `curl -sf http://localhost:6006/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo ok`.

## Configure via the CLI

Backend credentials and per-harness settings live in `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`. Edit it with `ax-trace config` rather than hand-editing — no bootstrap, api keys masked by default.

```bash
ax-trace config show                                   # whole config (api_key masked)
ax-trace config get harnesses.claude-code.project_name
ax-trace config set harnesses.claude-code.project_name my-project
ax-trace config set verbose true
ax-trace config delete harnesses.claude-code.space_id
ax-trace config edit                                   # open in $EDITOR
ax-trace config show --reveal                          # unmask api keys
```

Schema:

```yaml
harnesses:
  claude-code:
    project_name: claude-code       # Arize/Phoenix project
    target: arize                   # arize | phoenix
    endpoint: otlp.arize.com:443    # OTLP (arize) or Phoenix URL
    api_key: <key>
    space_id: <id>                  # arize only
logging:
  prompts: true                     # log user prompt text
  tool_details: true                # log tool args (commands, paths, URLs)
  tool_content: true                # log tool input/output content
user_id: ""                         # optional, added as user.id
verbose: false                      # terminal trace summaries (ARIZE_VERBOSE env wins)
```

## Claude-specific: where config lives

Claude Code tracing has **two possible install paths**, and where settings live (and how you debug/uninstall) depends on which was used:

- **Installed via `ax-trace` or `install.sh`:** backend credentials are in `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`; the hook registrations + `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED` env live in `~/.claude/settings.json`. Use `ax-trace config` to edit, `ax-trace doctor` to debug, `ax-trace uninstall --claude` to remove.
- **Installed via the Claude Plugin marketplace:** the wizard is skipped. Hooks load from the plugin, and backend credentials must be set directly in `~/.claude/settings.json` under the `env` block (`ARIZE_API_KEY`, `ARIZE_SPACE_ID`, `ARIZE_OTLP_ENDPOINT`, or `PHOENIX_*`). There may be **no** `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`. To debug, inspect `~/.claude/settings.json`; to remove, `claude plugin uninstall claude-code-tracing@coding-harness-tracing`.

When debugging, **check which install the user has first** (does `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` exist and contain a `harnesses.claude-code` block?) before assuming where credentials are.

## Diagnose with doctor

```bash
ax-trace doctor
```

Pure-Go health check — works even when the venv is broken. Reads `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`, the harness settings files, env vars, and probes the OTLP endpoint. Each line is `✓` (pass) or `✗` (fail) with a remediation hint; exits non-zero if anything fails.

| Verdict | Meaning / fix |
|---------|---------------|
| `✗ venv` | Runtime missing/broken → `ax-trace add claude` (or `ax-trace update`) to rebuild |
| `✗ settings:claude_code` | `~/.claude/settings.json` missing or unparseable → re-run `ax-trace add claude`, or fix JSON |
| `✗ env:claude_code` | No `ARIZE_*`/`PHOENIX_*` creds in env or config → `ax-trace config set harnesses.claude-code.api_key ...` (or set the env var for marketplace installs) |
| `✗ otlp_endpoint` | Endpoint unreachable (5xx/timeout) → check network/endpoint; retry |
| all `✓` but no traces | Confirm `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED=true` and restart the session; see [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot) |

## Agent SDK setup

For apps built on the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview). **Provide the snippets for the developer to add to their code — the agent can't wire this up at runtime** since plugin paths/settings must be set before the SDK session starts. The user must use `ClaudeSDKClient`; the standalone `query()` does not support hooks.

1. Pick a backend and ensure `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` has credentials (run `ax-trace add claude` once, or [Backends](#backends)).
2. Get the plugin path: installed via ax-trace/install.sh → `~/.arize/harness/tracing/claude_code`; via marketplace → check `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json`; not installed → `git clone https://github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing.git` and use `./coding-harness-tracing/tracing/claude_code`.
3. The SDK subprocess doesn't inherit shell env, so pass tracing env via a settings file:

```json
{ "env": { "ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED": "true" } }
```

4. Wire both into `ClaudeAgentOptions`:

**Python**
```python
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions, ClaudeSDKClient

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    plugins=[{"type": "local", "path": "~/.arize/harness/tracing/claude_code"}],
    settings="./settings.local.json",
)
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
    await client.query("...")
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        print(message)
```

**TypeScript**
```typescript
import { ClaudeSDKClient } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const client = new ClaudeSDKClient({
  plugins: [{ type: "local", path: "~/.arize/harness/tracing/claude_code" }],
  settings: "./settings.local.json",
});
await client.connect();
await client.query("...");
```

`tracing.claude_code.agent_sdk.claude_options()` returns a pre-wired `ClaudeAgentOptions` when the harness is installed via ax-trace/install.sh.

**Notes:** The Python SDK historically omits `SessionStart`/`SessionEnd`/`Notification`/`PermissionRequest`; the plugin lazily initializes session state on first `UserPromptSubmit`, so LLM/tool/subagent spans still work. Validate with `"ARIZE_DRY_RUN": "true"` in the settings file and check `~/.arize/harness/logs/claude-code.log`.

## Uninstall

```bash
ax-trace uninstall --claude     # remove Claude Code tracing, keep the shared runtime
ax-trace uninstall              # remove all harnesses + the shared runtime
```

Marketplace installs: `claude plugin uninstall claude-code-tracing@coding-harness-tracing`.

## Troubleshoot

Run `ax-trace doctor` first. Then:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Traces not appearing | `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED` must be `"true"` in `~/.claude/settings.json`; restart the session |
| Config missing (ax-trace install) | `ax-trace add claude`, or `ax-trace config set harnesses.claude-code.api_key ...` |
| Config missing (marketplace install) | Set `ARIZE_*`/`PHOENIX_*` in `~/.claude/settings.json` `env` block — there is no config.yaml |
| Phoenix unreachable | `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces` |
| No output in terminal | Hook stderr is discarded by Claude Code; read `~/.arize/harness/logs/claude-code.log` |
| Test without sending | `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` |
| Verbose logging | `ax-trace config set verbose true` (or `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true`) |
| Wrong project name | `ax-trace config set harnesses.claude-code.project_name <name>` |
| Spans missing user attribution | `ax-trace config set user_id <id>` (or `ARIZE_USER_ID` env) |
