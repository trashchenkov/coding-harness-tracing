# Setup Tracing

Configure OpenInference tracing for Claude Code sessions or Agent SDK applications to Arize AX (cloud) or Phoenix (self-hosted). Spans are sent directly to the backend from hooks -- no background process or backend-specific dependencies are needed in the user's environment.

## How to Use This Skill

**This skill follows a decision tree workflow.** Start by asking the user where they are in the setup process:

1. **Are they using the Claude Code CLI or the Agent SDK?**
   - CLI -> Continue to step 2
   - Agent SDK (Python or TypeScript) -> Go to [Agent SDK Setup](#agent-sdk-setup)

2. **Do they already have credentials?**
   - Yes -> Jump to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings)
   - No -> Continue to step 3

3. **Which backend do they want to use?**
   - Phoenix (self-hosted) -> Go to [Set Up Phoenix](#set-up-phoenix)
   - Arize AX (cloud) -> Go to [Set Up Arize AX](#set-up-arize-ax)

4. **Are they troubleshooting?**
   - Yes -> Jump to [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)

**Important:** Only follow the relevant path for the user's needs. Don't go through all sections.

## Set Up Phoenix

Phoenix is self-hosted. No Python dependencies are needed for tracing -- spans are sent directly via `send_span()` using stdlib `urllib`.

### Install Phoenix

Ask if they already have Phoenix running. If not, walk through:

```bash
# Option A: pip
pip install arize-phoenix && phoenix serve

# Option B: Docker
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

Phoenix UI will be available at `http://localhost:6006`. Confirm it's running:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:6006/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo "Phoenix is running" || echo "Phoenix not reachable"
```

Then proceed to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings) with the Phoenix endpoint.

## Set Up Arize AX

Arize AX is available as a SaaS platform or as an on-prem deployment. Users need an account, a space, and an API key.

**First, ask the user: "Are you using the Arize SaaS platform or an on-prem instance?"**

- **SaaS** -> Uses the default endpoint (`otlp.arize.com:443`). Continue below.
- **On-prem** -> The user will need to provide their custom OTLP endpoint (e.g., `otlp.mycompany.arize.com:443`). Ask for it and note it for the [Configure Settings](#configure-settings) step.

### 1. Create an account

If the user doesn't have an Arize account:
- **SaaS**: Sign up at https://app.arize.com/auth/join
- **On-prem**: Contact their administrator for access to the on-prem instance

### 2. Get Space ID and API key

Walk the user through finding their credentials:
1. Log in to their Arize instance (https://app.arize.com for SaaS, or their on-prem URL)
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
3. The **Space ID** is shown on the Space Settings page
4. Go to the **API Keys** tab
5. Click **Create API Key** or copy an existing one

Both `api_key` and `space_id` are required for the shared config.

**No Python dependencies are needed.** Both Phoenix and Arize AX use HTTP/JSON — no additional Python dependencies are needed.

Then proceed to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings). If the user is on an on-prem instance, remind them to provide their custom endpoint.

## Configure Settings

**Important:** For marketplace installs, users must run this setup skill before tracing will work. The `send_span()` function requires `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` to exist for backend credential resolution.

Configuration has two parts:

1. **Backend config** (`~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`) -- backend credentials and per-harness settings, read by `send_span()`. This skill creates it.
2. **Claude settings** (`~/.claude/settings.json` or `.claude/settings.local.json`) -- tracing feature flags and user-level env vars

### Ask the user for:

1. **Scope**: Global (`~/.claude/settings.json`) or project-local (`.claude/settings.local.json`)
2. **Backend choice**: Phoenix or Arize AX
3. **Credentials** (only if no existing config):
   - Phoenix: endpoint URL (default: `http://localhost:6006`), optional API key
   - Arize AX: API key and Space ID
4. **OTLP Endpoint** (Arize AX only, optional): For hosted Arize instances using a custom endpoint. Defaults to `otlp.arize.com:443`.
5. **Project name** (optional): defaults to `"claude-code"`, stored under `harnesses.claude-code.project_name`
6. **User ID** (optional): Set `ARIZE_USER_ID` to identify spans by user (useful for teams)

### Write the backend config

The config file at `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` is the single source of truth for backend credentials and per-harness settings. Create the directory structure if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.arize/harness/{bin,run,logs}`

**Important: read-merge-write.** If `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` already exists, read it first, then merge in the new or updated fields (e.g., add/update the `harnesses.claude-code` entry) while preserving existing backend credentials. Only prompt for backend credentials if no existing config is found.

**Phoenix:**
```yaml
harnesses:
  claude-code:
    project_name: claude-code
    target: phoenix
    endpoint: <endpoint>
    api_key: ""
```

**Arize AX:**
```yaml
harnesses:
  claude-code:
    project_name: claude-code
    target: arize
    endpoint: otlp.arize.com:443
    api_key: <key>
    space_id: <id>
```

If the user has a custom OTLP endpoint, set it in `harnesses.claude-code.endpoint`.

### Write the Claude settings

**Determine the config file:**
- Global: `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Project-local: `.claude/settings.local.json` (create directory if needed: `mkdir -p .claude`)

Read the file (or create `{}` if it doesn't exist), then merge env vars into the `"env"` object.

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED": "true"
  }
}
```

If a custom project name was provided, set it in `harnesses.claude-code.project_name` in the config (`~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`), not as an env var.

If a user ID was provided, also set `"ARIZE_USER_ID": "<id>"`. This adds a `user.id` attribute to all traced spans.

**Example workflow:**
```bash
# For project-local
mkdir -p .claude
echo '{}' > .claude/settings.local.json
# Then use an editor to add env vars
```

### Validate

1. **Config exists**: Run `cat ~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` to verify the config file exists and has correct backend credentials.
2. **Phoenix** (if applicable): Run `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces >/dev/null` to check connectivity.

### Confirm

Tell the user:
- Backend config saved to `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`
- Claude settings saved to the chosen file:
  - Global: `~/.claude/settings.json`
  - Project-local: `.claude/settings.local.json`
- Restart the Claude Code session for tracing to take effect
- Spans are sent directly to the backend from hooks — no background process needed
- After restarting, traces will appear in their Phoenix UI or Arize AX dashboard under the project name
- Mention `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` to test without sending data
- Mention `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` for debug output
- Errors are always written to `~/.arize/harness/logs/claude-code.log`; set `ARIZE_VERBOSE` to `"true"` under `env` in `~/.claude/settings.json` to also capture routine hook activity (session_start, span emits, state transitions)

**Note**: Project-local settings override global settings for the same variables.

## Agent SDK Setup

For users building with the [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) (Python or TypeScript), the tracing plugin loads as a local plugin. **This section provides code and configuration for the developer to add to their application** -- the agent cannot set this up at runtime since plugin paths and settings must be configured before the SDK session starts.

**Important:** The user must use `ClaudeSDKClient` -- the standalone `query()` function does **not** support hooks, so tracing will not work with it.

### How to guide the user

When a user asks about Agent SDK tracing setup, provide them with the steps below to integrate into their own code. Do NOT try to execute `export` commands or modify their application source -- instead, give them the snippets to copy.

### 1. Choose a backend

Ask the user which backend they want. If they don't have credentials yet, walk them through [Set Up Phoenix](#set-up-phoenix) or [Set Up Arize AX](#set-up-arize-ax) first, then return here.

### 2. Get the plugin path

Ask the user: **"Have you already installed this plugin via the Claude Code CLI?"**

**If yes (already installed via the `install.sh` / `install.bat` flow):** The plugin lives inside the harness install directory at `~/.arize/harness/tracing/claude_code`.

**If yes (installed via the Claude marketplace):** They can reference it from the CLI cache. Tell them to check `~/.claude/plugins/installed_plugins.json` for the exact path.

**If no:** Tell them to clone the repo into their project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arize-ai/coding-harness-tracing.git
```
The plugin path will be `./coding-harness-tracing/tracing/claude_code`.

> Tip: `tracing.claude_code.agent_sdk.claude_options()` returns a pre-configured `ClaudeAgentOptions` with the plugin path and `setting_sources=["user"]` already wired in, so users can skip the manual plumbing in step 5 below when the harness is installed via `install.sh`.

No Python dependencies are needed -- both Phoenix and Arize AX use HTTP/JSON.

### 3. Set up the backend config

Ensure `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` has the correct backend credentials (see [Configure Settings](#configure-settings) above).

### 4. Create a settings file

The Agent SDK spawns a Claude Code subprocess that does **not** inherit the user's shell environment variables. Tracing env vars must be passed via a settings file referenced in the `ClaudeAgentOptions`.

Tell the user to create a `settings.local.json` file (or similar):

```json
{
  "env": {
    "ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED": "true"
  }
}
```

Optional env vars that can also be added to the settings file:
- `ARIZE_USER_ID`: User identifier added as `user.id` attribute to all spans (useful for teams)
- `ARIZE_DRY_RUN`: Set to `"true"` to test without sending data
- `ARIZE_VERBOSE`: Set to `"true"` for debug output

To customize the project name, set it in `harnesses.claude-code.project_name` in the config (`~/.arize/harness/config.yaml`) rather than as an env var.

### 5. Add the plugin to their code

Give the user the appropriate snippet to add to their application. They must use `ClaudeSDKClient` and pass both the plugin path (from step 2) and the settings file (from step 4):

**Python:**
```python
from claude_agent_sdk import ClaudeAgentOptions, ClaudeSDKClient

PLUGIN_PATH = "./coding-harness-tracing/tracing/claude_code"  # or ~/.arize/harness/tracing/claude_code if installed via install.sh

options = ClaudeAgentOptions(
    plugins=[{"type": "local", "path": PLUGIN_PATH}],
    settings="./settings.local.json",
)
async with ClaudeSDKClient(options=options) as client:
    await client.query("Your prompt here")
    async for message in client.receive_response():
        print(message)
```

**TypeScript:**
```typescript
import { ClaudeSDKClient } from "@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk";

const PLUGIN_PATH = "./coding-harness-tracing/tracing/claude_code"; // or ~/.arize/harness/tracing/claude_code if installed via install.sh

const client = new ClaudeSDKClient({
  plugins: [{ type: "local", path: PLUGIN_PATH }],
  settings: "./settings.local.json",
});

await client.connect();
await client.query("Your prompt here");
for await (const message of client.receiveResponse()) {
  console.log(message);
}
await client.close();
```

### 6. Validate

Tell the user to add `"ARIZE_DRY_RUN": "true"` to their settings file to verify hooks fire without sending data, and check `~/.arize/harness/logs/claude-code.log` for output.

### Agent SDK Compatibility

For full Agent SDK documentation, see: https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview

- **Important**: You must use `ClaudeSDKClient` -- the standalone `query()` function does not support hooks and tracing will not work.
- **Hook coverage**: The CLI registers a broad hook set (16 events as of this writing, including session-lifecycle, prompt/tool, compaction, and permission events). The Agent SDKs may expose a smaller subset depending on version; check the SDK's `HookEvent` enum / type for the events your SDK version supports.
- **Python SDK** in particular has historically not supported `SessionStart`, `SessionEnd`, `Notification`, and `PermissionRequest`. The plugin handles this automatically -- session state is lazily initialized on the first `UserPromptSubmit`, so core tracing (LLM spans, tool spans, subagent spans) works fully.
- Tracing env vars must be passed via a settings file in `ClaudeAgentOptions` -- the SDK subprocess does not inherit shell environment variables.
- If the user is **troubleshooting** an existing Agent SDK setup, you can help by checking log files (`~/.arize/harness/logs/claude-code.log`), verifying the settings file contains the correct env vars, verifying `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` has correct backend credentials, or enabling dry-run mode.

## Troubleshoot

Common issues and fixes:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Traces not appearing | Check `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED` is `"true"` in Claude settings, and verify config exists: `cat ~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` |
| Config missing | Run the installer or create `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` manually (include `harnesses` section) |
| Phoenix unreachable | Verify Phoenix is running: `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces` |
| No output in terminal | Hook stderr is discarded by Claude Code; check `~/.arize/harness/logs/claude-code.log` |
| Want to test without sending | Set `ARIZE_DRY_RUN` to `"true"` in env config |
| Want verbose logging | Set `ARIZE_VERBOSE` to `"true"` in env config |
| Wrong project name | Set `harnesses.claude-code.project_name` in `~/.arize/harness/config.yaml` (default: `"claude-code"`) |
| Spans missing user attribution | Set `ARIZE_USER_ID` in env config to add `user.id` to all spans |
