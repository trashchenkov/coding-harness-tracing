# Setup omp Tracing

Configure OpenInference tracing for **Oh My Pi (omp)** terminal coding sessions to Arize AX (cloud) or Phoenix (self-hosted). OMP loads its extensions [in-process inside its Bun runtime](https://omp.sh/docs/hooks). The integration ships as a small TypeScript hook shim that forwards OMP's lifecycle events to a short-lived Python dispatcher (`arize-hook-omp`). The shim awaits dispatcher completion (bounded to 1.5 seconds) so state mutations preserve lifecycle order; span export remains asynchronous and fail-soft. No separate buffer/collector service is required.

## How to Use This Skill

**This skill follows a decision tree workflow.** Start by asking the user where they are in the setup process:

1. **Is the harness already installed?**
   - Check `~/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts` for the Arize hook shim
   - Check `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` for the shim's path in the `extensions` array
   - Check `~/.arize/harness/config.json` for the `harnesses.omp` block
   - If all are present -> Jump to [Validate](#validate) or [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)

2. **Do they already have credentials?**
   - Yes -> Jump to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings)
   - No -> Continue to step 3

3. **Which backend do they want to use?**
   - Phoenix (self-hosted) -> Go to [Set Up Phoenix](#set-up-phoenix)
   - Arize AX (cloud) -> Go to [Set Up Arize AX](#set-up-arize-ax)

4. **Are they troubleshooting?**
   - Yes -> Jump to [Troubleshoot](#troubleshoot)

**Important:** Only follow the relevant path for the user's needs. Don't go through all sections.

## Set Up Phoenix

Phoenix is self-hosted. No Python dependencies are needed for tracing -- spans are sent directly via `send_span()` using stdlib `urllib`.

### Install Phoenix

Ask if they already have Phoenix running. If not, walk through:

```bash
# Option A: pip
pip install arize-phoenix && phoenix serve

# Option B: Docker
docker run -p 6006:6006 arizephoenix/phoenix:latest
```

Phoenix UI will be available at `http://localhost:6006`. Confirm it's running:

```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:6006/v1/traces >/dev/null && echo "Phoenix is running" || echo "Phoenix not reachable"
```

Then proceed to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings) with the Phoenix endpoint.

## Set Up Arize AX

Arize AX is available as a SaaS platform or as an on-prem deployment. Users need an account, a space, and an API key.

**First, ask the user: "Are you using the Arize SaaS platform or an on-prem instance?"**

- **SaaS** -> Uses the default endpoint (`otlp.arize.com:443`). Continue below.
- **On-prem** -> The user will need to provide their custom OTLP endpoint (e.g., `otlp.mycompany.arize.com:443`). Ask for it and note it for the [Configure Settings](#configure-settings) step.

### 1. Create an account

If the user doesn't have an Arize account:
- **SaaS**: Sign up at https://app.arize.com/auth/join
- **On-prem**: Contact their administrator for access to the on-prem instance

### 2. Get Space ID and API key

Walk the user through finding their credentials:
1. Log in to their Arize instance (https://app.arize.com for SaaS, or their on-prem URL)
2. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
3. The **Space ID** is shown on the Space Settings page
4. Go to the **API Keys** tab
5. Click **Create API Key** or copy an existing one

Both `api_key` and `space_id` are required for the shared config.

**No Python dependencies are needed.** Both Phoenix and Arize AX use HTTP/JSON -- no additional Python dependencies are needed.

Then proceed to [Configure Settings](#configure-settings). If the user is on an on-prem instance, remind them to provide their custom endpoint.

## Configure Settings

**Important:** Users must run this setup before tracing will work. The `send_span()` function requires `~/.arize/harness/config.json` to exist for backend credential resolution.

### Ask the user for:

1. **Backend choice**: Phoenix or Arize AX
2. **Credentials** (only if no existing config):
   - Phoenix: endpoint URL (default: `http://localhost:6006`), optional API key
   - Arize AX: API key and Space ID
3. **OTLP Endpoint** (Arize AX only, optional): For hosted Arize instances using a custom endpoint. Defaults to `otlp.arize.com:443`.
4. **Project name** (optional): defaults to `"omp"`, stored under `harnesses.omp.project_name`
5. **User ID** (optional): Set `ARIZE_USER_ID` env var to identify spans by user (useful for teams)

### Write the config

The config file at `~/.arize/harness/config.json` is the single source of truth for backend credentials and per-harness settings. Create the directory structure if needed: `mkdir -p ~/.arize/harness/{bin,run,logs,state/omp}`

**Important: read-merge-write.** If `~/.arize/harness/config.json` already exists, read it first, then merge in the new or updated fields (e.g., add/update the `harnesses.omp` entry) while preserving existing backend credentials. Only prompt for backend credentials if no existing config is found.

**Phoenix:**
```json
{
  "harnesses": {
    "omp": {
      "project_name": "omp",
      "target": "phoenix",
      "endpoint": "<endpoint>",
      "api_key": ""
    }
  }
}
```

If Phoenix requires authentication (e.g. Phoenix Cloud), set the API key here under
`api_key`, or export `PHOENIX_API_KEY` in the environment — it is sent as a
`Authorization: Bearer <key>` header. The env var takes precedence over the config value.
Leave `api_key: ""` for an unauthenticated local Phoenix.

**Arize AX:**
```json
{
  "harnesses": {
    "omp": {
      "project_name": "omp",
      "target": "arize",
      "endpoint": "otlp.arize.com:443",
      "api_key": "<key>",
      "space_id": "<id>"
    }
  }
}
```

If the user has a custom OTLP endpoint, set it in `harnesses.omp.endpoint`.

### Activate the omp hook

omp does **not** auto-discover an extensions directory — the `extensions` key in `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` is an explicit array of file/dir paths omp loads ([hook docs](https://omp.sh/docs/hooks)). The installer drops the Arize hook shim at `~/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts` **and** registers that absolute path in the `extensions` array, e.g.:

```json
{ "extensions": ["/Users/me/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts"] }
```

omp picks up the registered extension on next launch.

Install or reinstall via the installer:

```bash
./install.sh omp
```

To uninstall:

```bash
./install.sh uninstall omp
```

Uninstall removes the shim's path from the `extensions` array, deletes the hook file at `~/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts` (only if it carries the Arize header marker — the installer never touches the user's own extensions), and removes the `harnesses.omp` block from `~/.arize/harness/config.json`.

### Validate

1. **Config exists**: Run `cat ~/.arize/harness/config.json` to verify the config file exists and has correct backend credentials under `harnesses.omp`.
2. **Phoenix** (if applicable): Run `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces >/dev/null` to check connectivity.
3. **Hook installed**: Verify `~/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts` exists and starts with the Arize header marker.
4. **Hook registered**: Verify the shim's absolute path appears in the `extensions` array of `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` (omp does not auto-discover — registration is required).
5. **Handler entry point**: Verify the handler binary exists at `~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-omp` (or `~/.arize/harness/venv/Scripts/arize-hook-omp.exe` on Windows). The shim spawns this binary by absolute path — it does not rely on PATH resolution. `install.sh` installs it as a venv entry point.

### Confirm

Tell the user:
- Config saved to `~/.arize/harness/config.json`
- omp hook shim installed at `~/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts`
- Shim path registered in the `extensions` array of `~/.omp/agent/settings.json` — omp requires explicit registration (no auto-discovery)
- Spans are sent directly to the backend from the handler — no background process needed
- After saving, open a new omp session and traces will appear in their Phoenix UI or Arize AX dashboard under the project name
- Mention `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` to test without sending data (set as env var before launching omp)
- Mention `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` for debug output
- Errors and handler stderr are always written to `~/.arize/harness/logs/omp.log` (the adapter redirects Python stderr there via `ARIZE_LOG_FILE`); set `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` in the shell before launching omp to also capture routine handler activity (event dispatch, span emits, state transitions)
- Toggle tracing on/off via `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED` env var (must be exported in the user's shell before launching omp — the shim and handler inherit host env vars)
- Tail the log file at `~/.arize/harness/logs/omp.log` for real-time debugging
- Mention `ARIZE_TRACE_DEBUG=true` to dump raw event payloads under `~/.arize/harness/state/debug/` (files are named `omp_before_agent_start_<ts>.json` / `omp_turn_end_<ts>.json` / `omp_agent_end_<ts>.json` / `omp_session_shutdown_<ts>.json`) for inspection

## Architecture (How spans are produced)

OMP loads its extensions **in-process** inside its Bun runtime ([hook docs](https://omp.sh/docs/hooks)). Unlike opencode, OMP exposes rich, **once-fired** lifecycle events that already carry final, structured data, so the Arize integration is a stateful event-forward with defensive replay idempotency rather than snapshot reconciliation. It is split into two pieces:

1. **TypeScript hook shim** at `~/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts`. A dumb bridge. On a whitelist of lifecycle events — `before_agent_start` (the prompt), `turn_end` (the completed `AssistantMessage` with inline token usage + model, plus that turn's `toolResults`), `agent_end` (run finished), and `session_shutdown` — it spawns `arize-hook-omp`, pipes the event payload to stdin, and awaits completion for at most 1.5 seconds. The shim contains no tracing logic; the bounded wait preserves lifecycle ordering and stays below OMP's 2-second shutdown hook deadline.
2. **Python event handler** (`arize-hook-omp`). A small state machine keyed by session id. It dispatches on `payload["type"]`, accumulates per-session state, and emits `Turn`/`LLM`/`TOOL` spans on receipt. Pairs each `ToolCall` with its `ToolResultMessage` by id to build TOOL spans with both input args and output.

## Span tree

Each trace covers one **agent run** (one user prompt → the agent's internal turn/tool-use loop → its final answer). A run usually contains several model calls; one trace covers all of them. The tree:

| Span | Kind | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| `Turn` | CHAIN | Root span. `input.value` is the user prompt (from `before_agent_start`); `output.value` is the final assistant message's text. One per agent run. |
| `LLM: <model>` | LLM | Child of `Turn`. One per `turn_end` (one per model call in the loop). Carries `llm.model_name`, `llm.provider`, prompt/completion/reasoning token counts, cache read/write tokens, and `llm.cost`. omp surfaces token usage inline on the assistant message, so it **is** captured. |
| `<tool>` | TOOL | Child of `Turn`. One per `ToolResultMessage` in a `turn_end`, paired with its originating `ToolCall` by id. Records `tool.name`, redacted input args + output, and tool-specific attributes; errors are recorded with span status. |

## Troubleshoot

Common issues and fixes for omp:

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Traces not appearing | Verify config exists: `cat ~/.arize/harness/config.json`. Check handler log: `tail -20 ~/.arize/harness/logs/omp.log`. Confirm the hook is in place: `ls ~/.omp/extensions/arize-tracing.ts`. |
| Hook not loading | omp does **not** auto-discover an extensions dir. Confirm the shim's absolute path is in the `extensions` array of `~/.omp/agent/settings.json`, then restart omp and check its CLI output for extension errors. |
| Handler entry point missing | The shim spawns the handler by absolute path; verify the binary exists at `~/.arize/harness/venv/bin/arize-hook-omp` (or `~/.arize/harness/venv/Scripts/arize-hook-omp.exe` on Windows). Rerun `./install.sh omp` to reinstall the venv entry point. |
| Missing LLM or tool spans | Spans emit on `turn_end` (one LLM span per model call, one TOOL span per tool result). If a turn hasn't completed yet, its spans won't appear until the event fires. Wait for the agent run to finish (`agent_end`). |
| Trace missing the final answer | `output.value` on the `Turn` span comes from the final assistant message. Confirm the run reached `agent_end`. |
| Phoenix unreachable | Verify Phoenix is running: `curl -sf <endpoint>/v1/traces` |
| Want to test without sending | Set `ARIZE_DRY_RUN=true` env var before launching omp |
| Want verbose logging | Set `ARIZE_VERBOSE=true` env var before launching omp |
| Want raw event payloads for inspection | Set `ARIZE_TRACE_DEBUG=true` env var; payloads land under `~/.arize/harness/state/debug/` as `omp_before_agent_start_<ts>.json` / `omp_turn_end_<ts>.json` / `omp_agent_end_<ts>.json` / `omp_session_shutdown_<ts>.json` |
| Wrong project name | Set `harnesses.omp.project_name` in `~/.arize/harness/config.json` (default: `"omp"`) |
| Spans missing user attribution | Set `ARIZE_USER_ID` env var before launching omp |
| Tracing not toggling | Ensure `ARIZE_TRACE_ENABLED` is exported in your shell, not just set — the omp process and any shim-spawned handler inherit host env vars |
